### Create New Solid Start App

Start by creating a new Solid Start app using `create-solid`. Select **Solid Start** template when prompted:

<NpmCommand type="create" command="solid@latest" />

When creating the new Solid Start app, make sure to choose the **with-tailwindcss** option to automatically set up Tailwind CSS:

```bash
? Which template do you want to use? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
    bare
    hackernews
    with-auth
    with-mdx
❯   with-tailwindcss
    with-vitest
```

Once you have created the app, navigate into the project and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd {project-name}
```

<NpmCommand type="install" command="" />
