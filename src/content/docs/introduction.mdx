Neobrutalism is a design style that is characterized by its bold, high-contrast colors, raw textures, and a focus on functionality over aesthetics. It often features a mix of industrial materials, such as concrete and metal, with bright, vibrant colors.

This project is a port of [shadcn/ui Neobrutalism Components](https://www.neobrutalism.dev/docs) for [SolidUI](https://www.solid-ui.com/), which is an unofficial port of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) to [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/).
